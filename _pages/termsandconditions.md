## Terms and Conditions – Booking a Course

### Policy Updated December 2023

These Terms and Conditions apply to booking a course advertised on VentureBeyond's website. A different set of terms and conditions apply to the bespoke services described on VentureBeyond’s website.

## Booking

A course place is reserved on receipt by VentureBeyond of a completed booking form and payment as follows:

- If a half day course, payment of course fee in full
- If a full day course, booked at least 6 weeks prior to the course date, payment of a non-refundable deposit of £95.00 or the course fee in full (which includes a non-refundable deposit of £95.00)
- If a full day course, booked less than 6 weeks prior to the course date, payment of the course fee in full (which includes a non-refundable deposit of £95.00)
Booking forms can be completed on-line via VentureBeyond’s website or in paper format and sent to VentureBeyond.

A course place is confirmed when VentureBeyond has received and accepted a client’s booking form, required payment and issued to the client written confirmation of their booking. Course places and dates are subject to availability.

Payment of deposits and course fees must be paid in sterling via bank transfer or PayPal.

All balances must be paid in cleared funds at least 6 weeks prior to the commencement date of the course. If not paid in that timescale, VentureBeyond may treat the booking as cancelled by the client and attempt to re-sell the place. Cancellation charges as set out in these Terms and Conditions (Cancellation by Client) will apply.

The courses advertised by VentureBeyond on its website and elsewhere are illustrative only and while intended to provide an explanation of the type and scope of activities to be undertaken, the activities and/or the location of the course may be subject to change. VentureBeyond accepts no liability for, or the consequences, of any such changes.

All course fees include VAT

## Group Booking

If a client wishes to make a group booking a Main Contact must be provided in the booking form. VentureBeyond will only deal with the Main Contact in relation to the booking, including any changes or cancellation.

The Main Contact will be responsible for the payment of all deposits and course fees and it will be assumed by BtE that the Main Contact has authority to act on behalf of all group members. Each group member must complete and submit a booking form to VentureBeyond.

## Cancellation by the Client

All cancellations must be in writing (sent by post or email) and acknowledged by BtE. Cancellation costs charged to the client are:
If a half day course:
- Where the course place is re-sold by VentureBeyond prior to the commencement date of the course – 50% of the course fee
Where the course place is unable to be re-sold by VentureBeyond prior to the commencement date of the course and the cancellation is:

- more than 6 weeks prior to the commencement date of the course – 50% of the course fee
- at 6 weeks or less prior to the commencement date of the course – 100% of the course fee
If a full day course: 

- Where the course place is re-sold by VentureBeyond prior to the commencement date of the course – the lesser of the non-refundable deposit of £95 and 25% of the course fee
Where the course place is unable to be re-sold by VentureBeyond prior to the commencement date of the course and the cancellation is:

- more than 6 weeks prior to the commencement date of the course – the greater of the non-refundable deposit of £95 or 25% of the course fee
- at 6 weeks or less prior to the commencement date of the course – 50% of the course fee
- at 4 weeks or less prior to the commencement date of the course – 100% of the course fee.
Deposits are non refundable.

Any refunds due, after deduction of cancellation costs, will be made within 15 working days of BtE acknowledging the cancellation.

## Cancellation by VentureBeyond

Whilst every attempt is made to ensure courses run as advertised, VentureBeyond reserves the right to cancel any course due to:

- Circumstances outside its control, including, but not limited to, war, civil unrest, strikes, accident, incapacitating illness, fire, flood, travel disruption
- Dangerous and / or unsuitable conditions for the course being present or forecast
- Minimum numbers for National Governing Body (NGB) training and / or assessment courses set by the licensing authority Mountain Training England (Award Courses) not being met
If VentureBeyond cancels an NGB / Award Course because minimum numbers are not met, VentureBeyond will notify clients not less than 10 calendar days prior to the commencement date of the course. If cancelled for any other reason, or a non-NGB / Award course is cancelled, VentureBeyond will notify clients as soon as reasonably practicable.

Where a course is cancelled by VentureBeyond a client will be offered:

- A full refund of the course fee/deposit they have paid, or
- Another course on a different date. Any difference in the cost of the cancelled course and the other course will (as appropriate) be credited by VentureBeyond or paid by the client in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

## Changing a Booking

At the discretion of VentureBeyond, a client may amend or change their booking.

## Participation Statement

Whilst safety is paramount in all our activities, mountaineering and its allied activities contain an element of inherent risk. All clients of BtE are deemed to understand and accept as a condition of their booking the following British Mountaineering Council (BMC) participation statement:

‘The BMC recognises that climbing, hill walking and mountaineering are activities with a danger of personal injury or death. Participants in these activities should be aware of and accept these risks and be responsible for their own actions’.

VentureBeyond reserves the right to terminate part or all of a course or to exclude a client from all or part of a course if a client’s actions present a danger to themselves and / or others or is detrimental to others enjoyment of the course. If VentureBeyond exercises its right to terminate all or part of a course no refund of course fees will occur.

A client participating in a course who does not obey the safety guidance or instructions of VentureBeyond or its staff and / or undertakes independent activities during a course will be deemed to have removed themselves from the course and will not be covered by any duty of care or the professional insurance of VentureBeyond or any of its staff (for the avoidance of doubt, references to staff in these Terms and Conditions includes the instructors/course directors that BVentureBeyond engages to deliver its courses). No refund of course fees will occur.

## Health and Fitness

VentureBeyond must be made fully aware of any medical problem, condition, disability, injuries or medication of a client prior to booking. If any of these medical issues change, arise or are suffered, between booking and the commencement of the course VentureBeyond must be notified immediately.

Any individual who has current symptoms of Coronavirus or has been in recent contact with anyone suspected of having Coronavirus should follow Government guidelines and self isolate. They should not attend a course.

If a client develops symptoms of Coronavirus within 14 days of attending a course, the client agrees to inform Beyond the Edge as soon as reasonably possible of this.

VentureBeyond reserves the right to refuse or cancel a booking on medical grounds, if it is considered to be detrimental to the safety and smooth running of the course. If cancelled, the cancellation charges set out in these Terms and Conditions (Cancellation by the Client) will apply.

Clients should familiarise themselves with the different levels of exertion likely to be needed for the different courses offered by VentureBeyond and choose a course that is suitable for their level of health and fitness. If there is any doubt as to the level of fitness required for a particular course or activity, please contact BtE prior to booking. Clients should arrive for the course suitably fit and prepared for the activities.

## Equipment

The client is responsible at all times for their personal property and equipment and for ensuring it is suitable and safe for use on the course. VentureBeyond will not be responsible for any loss or damage to a client’s personal property or equipment used on a course.

If VentureBeyond issues a client with property or equipment for use on a course, the client will at all times be responsible for its safekeeping and proper use. VentureBeyond reserves the right to charge for any property and / or equipment lost, damaged or misused by a client on a course.

## Transport

Transport is not included within the course fee. It is the client’s responsibility to get to the course location / venue at the time specified. It may be necessary for a client to utilise their own transport during a course: if they do, VentureBeyond accepts no responsibility for any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly from that use.

## Insurance

For all courses, clients are advised to take out travel and / or personal insurance that covers them for the course activities they will be undertaking. These insurance policies will usually include cover for cancellation, curtailment, loss or damage to personal property and equipment, personal accident and personal liability. It is a client’s responsibility to ensure they are adequately insured.

## Limitation of Liability

Except to the extent expressly stated in these Terms and Conditions, BtE will not be liable where any failure or delay in the delivery of a course is due to:

- the client
- an event described in these Terms and Conditions (Cancellation by VentureBeyond)
- any other unusual and / or unforeseeable circumstances or event beyond VentureBeyond’s control or which VentureBeyond could not have foreseen
VentureBeyond will not be liable for any damage to or loss of a client’s personal property, equipment or vehicle.
